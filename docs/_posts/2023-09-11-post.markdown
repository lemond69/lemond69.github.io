title: Detecting cloud sandboxes in ring 3 using timing attack
---
So recently, I came across [this](https://github.com/void-stack/Hypervisor-Detection/) github repo, which claims to be able to detect all sandboxes and VMs, including cloud sandboxes such as [any.run](https://app.any.run/). Of course, this is a claim made by many, and is rarely backed up, and the proof provided did seem convincing, so I took a look, and tried to compile it. I modified the code into C, stripped off all the unnecessary parts (and only kept the CPUID vs FYL2XP1 section), and got this:
```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <intrin.h>

struct _cpuid_buffer_t
{
    uint32_t EAX;
    uint32_t EBX;
    uint32_t ECX;
    uint32_t EDX;
};

int main(){
    LARGE_INTEGER start;
    LARGE_INTEGER end;
    double ration=0;
    for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&start);
        asm("FYL2XP1");
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&end);
        double fy = end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart;
        
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&start);
        struct _cpuid_buffer_t cpuid_data;
        __cpuid((int*)(&cpuid_data), 1);
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&end);
        double cpu = end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart;
        ration+=cpu/fy;
    }
    ration/=100;
    printf("%f\n", ration);
    if(ration > 1) printf("SANDBOX DETECTED!!!\n");
    else printf("Clean\n");
}
```

Sadly, after testing the code, it seemed to have some significant results overlap between a physical and virtual machine. Scores shown below are of average `CPUID`:`FYL2XP1` timing ratio:
-   Wine on i7-1165G7: 0.8
-   Windows 7 on KVM: 4.2
-   [Triage](https://tria.ge/) Windows 7: 1.95
-   any.run Windows 7: 1.2
-   Triage Windows 10 2004: 6.05
-   Native Windows 10 on [Pentium Gold 4425Y](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/192786/intel-pentium-gold-processor-4425y-2m-cache-1-70-ghz.html): 3.5

As we can see, there is significant overlap between the Pentium and the Windows 7 virtual machines. However, I also noted that for the specific version of the OS, the physical machines do seem to have a lower score than for virtual machines. As such, I suspected that some changes in Windows API (specifically the __cpuid call) was introduced, and hence swapped it out for an ASM instruction.

After some experimentation, we result in this code:
```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define THRESHOLD 4.8
#define MAX_SAND 60 // 40/100 is minimum score
int main(){
    LARGE_INTEGER start;
    LARGE_INTEGER end;
    int phys=0;
    int sand=0;
    double sum=0;
    for(int j=0;j<100;j++){
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&start);
        for(int i=0;i<100;i++) asm("FYL2XP1");
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&end);
        double fy = end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart;
        
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&start);
        for(int i=0;i<100;i++) asm("push eax\n\tpush ebx\n\tpush ecx\n\tpush edx\n\txor eax, eax\n\tCPUID\n\tpop edx\n\tpop ecx\n\tpop ebx\n\tpop eax");
        QueryPerformanceCounter(&end);
        double cpu = end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart;
        double ration=cpu/fy;
        if(ration > THRESHOLD) sand++;
        else phys++;
        sum+=ration;
        Sleep(10);
    }
    sum/=100;
    printf("Avg. score: %f\n", sum);
    printf("%d%% likely to be physical\n", phys);
    if(sand>MAX_SAND) printf("SANDBOX DETECTED!!!\n");
    else printf("Clean\n");
}
```


After testing the code, we discover that there is NO overlap between physical and virtual machines, confirming the theory that there was likely a WINAPI change between Windows 7 and 10. Results, where THRESHOLD=4.8, and 100%=physical machine, 0%=sandbox:
-   Wine on i7-1165G7: 100%
-   Windows 7 on KVM: 0%
-   Triage Windows 7: 0-3%
-   any.run Windows 7: 0-2%
-   Triage Windows 10 1703: 7-21%
-   Triage Windows 10 2004: 0-5%
-   Native Windows 10 on Pentium Gold 4425Y: 64-100%
-   Native Windows 10 on [AMD Ryzen 9 PRO 7940HS](https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-9-pro-7940hs): 100%

Note that I added a MAX_SAND variable instead of just using a 50% pass/fail method. This is because I noted that at THRESHOLD=4.8, the lowest score a physical machine would get was 64%, while the highest scored for a sandbox was 21%. As such, instead of trying to adjust the threshold further, I just met in the middle and set 40% as the pass grade.

I have also noticed that there is a rather large score differential observed for the Pentium machine. The score can hit as low as 64% when under heavy load (this score was observed when I opened both Teams and a large IDE at once), as such, I added a `Sleep(10)` delay for each cycle, so as to allow measurements to be taken over a large timespan, and hence be more accurate.

The theory behind this is because `FYL2XP1` is a really slow floating point instruction, it allows for good timing baseline (instead of a fixed time constant, to have a baseline for the CPU). As such, we can see how much comparatively slower the `CPUID` instruction is, as the hypervisor needs to lookup the host/preset CPUID value, which would take comparatively longer than a native `CPUID` instruction.

As for mitigations, I am really unsure of whether this is possible to mitigate without major changes to the hypervisor.

In conclusion, we deem this method to be one of the only few methods capable of reliably detecting advanced cloud sandboxes from ring 3 with high accuracy and near-zero false positives/negatives due to the large score differential between lowest physical score and highest sandbox score.
